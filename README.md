## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs unit tests with nyc and ava.
